These folders set up the models of both RM3 and the OSWEC as ODE problems, to which then are solved using ModelingToolkit, 
ModelingToolkitStandardLibrary, DifferentialEquations and Symbolics. For the moment, only the RM3 case file is working, however it is only modeled for the float part of the body.
